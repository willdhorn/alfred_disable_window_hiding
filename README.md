# Disable Window Hiding
This is a simple Alfred workflow that remaps ⌘H and ⇧⌘H to nothing in order to prevent accidentally hiding windows.

NOTE: This captures the key combination for all apps, making it imposiple to use as a shortcut for any app. If you need to use ⌘H with an app, you can manually edit the workflow to ignore the shortcut while a given app has focus.
